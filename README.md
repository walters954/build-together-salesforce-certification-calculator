# Salesforce Certification Calculator
### _[Salesforce Mentor - Build Together](https://courses.salesforcementor.com/)_

A month-long project you build on a team of 2-3 with other learning Salesforce developers. Small teams will work together to complete development assignments. Join weekly meetings with experienced developers to go over questions and review code.

## Overview
Create an LWC calculator for Salesforce certifications. Use LWC, HTML, JS, CSS, and other Salesforce development frameworks to create a UI and backend to dynamically render and calculate the scores. 
[All certification calculations can be found on Trailhead on the exam guides.](https://trailhead.salesforce.com/en/credentials/administratoroverview/) 
- Start with PD1 then update the calculator to work with other certifications.

## Project Requirements  
- Ability to select multiple certifications to calculate score - fields will be dynamic
- Ability to input certification scored for each section of platform developer 1 certification
- Button to initiate the calculate functionality 
- Once calculated show your score compared to the score needed to pass
- Error check if a field is blank - all fields are required
- Should work in a Salesforce as stand alone component or on record page

## Getting Started
- Fork this repository and (if team leader) [invite team members to repo](https://docs.github.com/en/account-and-profile/setting-up-and-managing-your-personal-account-on-github/managing-access-to-your-personal-repositories/inviting-collaborators-to-a-personal-repository) 
- Clone the forked repo onto your local computer and open the folder in Visual Studio Code
- Connect to your playground org and start coding! 

## Examples
- https://scuvanov.github.io/SalesforceCertScoreCalculator
- https://focusonforce.com/salesforce-certification-score-checker
- https://levelupsalesforce.com/saleforce-certification-calculator

## Development Requirements
- Must have completed and sent a review of Apex Fundamentals
- Must use SFDX, git, GitHub, and visual studio code
- Your code should be able to run in any playground org via a GitHub repo
- Must be able to commit to meeting weekly with a large group
- SLDS and LWC Library must be used for lightning web components

## Development Outline
1. Create a LWC - Name: Salesforce Certification Calculator
2. HTML - Create inputs for the users values - 4 inputs (Developer Fundamentals, Process Automation and Logic, User Interface,Testing, Debugging, and Deployment)
3. HTML - Text for the overall score
4. HTML - Create calculate button
5. JS - Calculate button press call the JS function to update the overall score

## Notes
- Build Together is meant to be challenging. You will be asked to figure things out with your team. Sr. Dev will guide you but not a full outline of what you should be doing. Asking questions is the more important thing.
- You can use other resources but donâ€™t just copy it word for word. You should be able to explain what your code is doing.
- Team members are meant to keep each other accountable, but if a team member is not pulling their weight, they will be cut.
